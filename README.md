# Vijaysankar's Blog (vijaynr.github.io)
A Personal Blogging website, built from Jekyll static template engine and hosted in Github pages

## How to build?

Github takes care of most of the things automagically from small changes (edits), building jekyll, deploying and hosting it at `vijaynr.github.io`, but for some complex changes, we might need to setup a local enviroment to work with.

## Prerequisites

- Install Ruby and Gem (Ruby's package manager), Check this [Jekyll Install Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
- Install Jekyll and Bundler (using  `gem`)
- Make sure the executables are in `PATH`

## How to build offline?

- Checkout or Clone this repository
- `cd` into `ROOT` project directory
- Run `bundle install` to install all project gem dependencies
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to host the website at `localhost:4000`
