I am excited to share my first blog post after five years in software engineering. During this time, I have researched various topics but kept my insights private, writing about 10 to 15 articles that never reached an audience. This marks the beginning of my writing journey.

As an engineer from a non-software background, I have faced insecurities due to my limited knowledge of key computer science concepts. However, I have turned these challenges into opportunities for growth. I aim to keep learning and will likely hold on to this (positive) insecurity throughout my career.

This blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge.

Join me as we explore the world of computer scienceâ€”a journey full of valuable insights.`
