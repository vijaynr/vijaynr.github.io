I have been waiting for a long time to get this started, and here we are, finally, to my maiden blogpost. It's has been arround 5 years, since I started my software engineering journey. I have been reading and taking notes about software engineering topics all this while and keeping it to myself, I might have written arround 10-15 articles (or notes) which never got to see the light. So, this would possibly be the genesis of my technical writing journey.

As an engineer from a non-software background, I have been dealing with insecurities right from the start of my career. I had my insecurities, due to my lack of knowledge (or less knowledge) on some core computer science topics (jargons). But, I did not let that bother me,  I took this as an opportunity to upskill and get better. This helped me to strive and learn for things I did no know about. And this learning journey hopefully never stops and I will probably hold on to this (good) insecurity to the very end. 

In this journey of many self discoveries and eureka moments, there would be lot of things to share and learn. 

> Sharing your knowledge is a way to accumulate more knowledge

So, the motive of this blog is aid knowledge sharing.

> Every new **journey** starts with a **beginnning**

Let's delve into the world of computer science, a journey without a destination, but a journey with abundant information and knowlege.
