I was waiting for a long while to get this started, and finally we are here **"My maiden blogpost!"**

It's has been arround 5 years, since I started a typical software engineering journey. I have been reading and taking notes about software engineering topics all this while and keeping it to myself, I might have written 10 odd articles which never got to see the light. So, this would possibly be the genesis of my writing journey (atleast publicly).

As an engineer from a non-software background, I have been dealing with insecurities from the beginning of my career. The lack of core computer science knowledge did not bother me at the first place, i took this as an opportunity to upskill and get better. This helped me to strive and learn for things I did'nt know. And this learning journey hopefully never stops and I will probably hold on to this insecurity to the very end. 

In this journey of many self discoveries and eureka moments (might be obvious to others), there would be lot of things to share and learn. 


> Sharing your knowledge is a way to accumulate more knowledge


The obvious motive of this blog is to share and gain knowledge.


> Every new **journey** starts with a **beginnning**


This is a type of journey where the destination is unknown, which also might be the right way to learn sofware engineering and life.
